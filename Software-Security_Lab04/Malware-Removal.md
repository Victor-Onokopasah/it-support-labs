# Lab 04: Malware Removal

**Objective:** Respond to a common help desk complaint of a "slow computer with weird pop-ups." Diagnose the system for malware, perform a full removal of identified threats (Adware/PUPs), restore system and browser settings to their original state, and document the entire remediation process with evidence and screenshots.

This exercise builds key IT support skills in:

*   Malware identification and diagnosis based on user-reported symptoms.
*   Using industry-standard security software for scanning and remediation.
*   Manual removal of Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs) and Adware remnants.
*   Web browser settings restoration (homepage, search engine, malicious extensions).
*   Documenting a security incident resolution for technical review and future reference.

### Key Skills Demonstrated

*   Adware/PUP diagnostics and analysis.
*   Malware remediation and quarantine procedures.
*   Web browser security and configuration.
*   Post-incident system verification and cleanup.
*   Effective user communication during a security incident.

### Tools Used

*   **Antivirus Software** (e.g., Windows Defender)
*   **Malwarebytes** (for targeted Adware/PUP scanning)
*   **ADWCleaner** (for specialized Adware and browser hijacker removal)
*   **Windows Safe Mode** (for isolating malware)
*   **Web Browser Settings** (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge)
*   **Screenshot Tools** (e.g., Windows Snipping Tool)

## Scenario & Initial Assessment

A user submitted a high-priority ticket with the following complaint: "My computer has become incredibly slow, and I'm getting constant pop-up ads everywhere. My browser homepage also changed to a weird search site, and I can't change it back. I think I have a virus."

The symptoms strongly indicate an Adware or Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP) infection.

## Malware Removal Procedure

### Step 1: Communication & Isolation

1.  **Established Communication:**
    *   Contacted the user to confirm the symptoms and provide reassurance.
    *   Asked clarifying questions: "When did this start?" and "Did you install any new 'free' software recently?" The user confirmed they downloaded a PDF converter program yesterday.

2.  **Isolate the Machine:**
    *   Instructed the user to **disconnect the computer from the network** (unplug the Ethernet cable or disable Wi-Fi) to prevent the malware from spreading or communicating with its server.
