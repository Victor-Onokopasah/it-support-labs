# Lab 04: - Malware Removal Guide

**Objective:** To document the standard operating procedure (SOP) for addressing common malware-related customer complaints. This guide outlines how to identify symptoms, isolate an affected system, use appropriate tools for diagnosis, and follow a structured scanning procedure for remediation.

This exercise builds key IT support skills in:

*   Interpreting user-reported issues to diagnose potential malware infections.
*   Systematically isolating a compromised machine to prevent further risk.
*   Employing a multi-tool strategy for effective malware scanning and removal.
*   Communicating effectively with a user during a stressful security incident.
*   Creating clear, actionable documentation for help desk procedures.

### Key Skills

*   Customer symptom analysis and communication.
*   Incident isolation and containment (Network Disconnect, Safe Mode).
*   Use of specialized security tools (Antivirus, Malwarebytes, ADWCleaner).
*   Layered scanning techniques (Quick vs. Full Scans).
*   Procedural documentation and best practices.

### Tools Used

*   **Installed Antivirus** (for full system scan)
*   **Malwarebytes** (for adware, PUPs, and general malware)
*   **ADWCleaner** (specialized for adware and browser hijackers)
*   **Microsoft Defender Offline** (for persistent or boot-level threats)
*   **Windows Safe Mode**

## Common Customer Complaints & Symptoms

This procedure is initiated when a customer contacts the help desk with one or more of the following red-flag symptoms, which strongly indicate a malware infection.

#### 🚨 **Immediate Red Flags**
- "My computer is incredibly slow and keeps freezing"
- "I'm getting constant pop-up ads everywhere"
- "My browser homepage changed and I can't change it back"
- "There are new toolbars/programs I didn't install"
- "My computer keeps redirecting to strange websites"
- (Critical) "My files have strange extensions and won't open"
- (Critical) "A message says my files are encrypted and demands payment"
- (Critical) "My antivirus disappeared and won't turn back on"

## Malware Removal Procedure

### Step 1: Initial Assessment & Isolation

The first priority is to contain the threat and gather information.

**Customer Communication:**
- *"I understand this is frustrating. Let's work through this step-by-step."*
- *"When did you first notice these symptoms?"*
- *"Have you downloaded any new software or clicked on any suspicious links recently?"*

**Technical Actions:**
1.  **Disconnect from network** - Unplug the Ethernet cable or disable Wi-Fi.
2.  **Boot into Safe Mode** - This prevents most malware from loading.
    -   *Windows Method: Hold Shift + Restart → Troubleshoot → Advanced Options → Startup Settings → Restart → Select Safe Mode.*
3.  **Document symptoms** for tracking and pattern recognition in the support ticket.

### Step 2: Identification & Scanning

With the system in a safe state, begin the scanning process.

**Primary Scanning Tools:**
1.  **Run installed antivirus** with a full system scan.
2.  **Use Malwarebytes** - Excellent for detecting and removing stubborn malware.
3.  **Microsoft Defender Offline** - Boots from a USB or recovery partition to scan before Windows loads.
4.  **ADWCleaner** - Specialized for adware and browser hijackers.

**Scanning Procedure:**
1.  Update all scanning tools to the latest virus definitions first.
2.  Run a quick scan initially to note immediate findings.
3.  Perform a full, in-depth system scan.
4.  Cross-reference the results from multiple tools for a comprehensive cleanup.
