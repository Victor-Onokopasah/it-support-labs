# Lab 04: Malware Removal Guide

**Objective:** To document the standard operating procedure (SOP) for addressing common malware-related customer complaints. This guide outlines the steps to identify symptoms, isolate an affected system, use appropriate tools for diagnosis and removal, and restore the system to a secure state.

This exercise builds key IT support skills in:

*   Interpreting user-reported issues to diagnose potential malware infections.
*   Systematically isolating a compromised machine to prevent further risk.
*   Employing a multi-tool strategy for effective malware scanning and removal.
*   Communicating effectively with a user during a stressful security incident.
*   Creating clear, actionable documentation for help desk procedures.

### Key Skills Demonstrated

*   Customer symptom analysis and communication.
*   Incident isolation and containment (network disconnection, Safe Mode).
*   Use of specialized security tools (Antivirus, Malwarebytes, ADWCleaner).
*   Layered scanning techniques (quick vs. full scans).
*   Procedural documentation.

### Tools Used

*   **Primary Antivirus** (Installed on the system)
*   **Malwarebytes** (For broad-spectrum malware and PUPs)
*   **ADWCleaner** (Specialized for adware, toolbars, and browser hijackers)
*   **Microsoft Defender Offline** (For rootkits and persistent threats)
*   **Windows Safe Mode**

## Scenario: Common Customer Complaints & Symptoms

This procedure is initiated when a customer contacts the help desk with one or more of the following red-flag symptoms, which strongly indicate a malware infection.

*   "My computer is incredibly slow and keeps freezing."
*   "I'm getting constant pop-up ads everywhere, even when my browser is closed."
*   "My browser homepage changed, and I can't change it back."
*   "There are new toolbars or programs I didn't install."
*   "My computer keeps redirecting to strange websites."
*   (Critical) "My files have strange extensions and won't open."
*   (Critical) "A message says my files are encrypted and demands payment."
*   (Critical) "My antivirus has disappeared or won't turn back on."

## Malware Removal Procedure

### Step 1: Initial Assessment & Isolation

The first priority is to contain the threat and gather information.

1.  **Customer Communication:**
    *   Acknowledge the user's frustration and provide reassurance: *"I understand this is frustrating. Let's work through this step-by-step."*
    *   Gather critical information: *"When did you first notice these symptoms?"* and *"Have you downloaded any new software or clicked on any suspicious links recently?"*

2.  **Technical Isolation:**
    *   **Action:** Direct the user to immediately **disconnect the computer from the network** (unplug the Ethernet cable or disable Wi-Fi). This prevents the malware from spreading or communicating with external servers.
    *   **Action:** Guide the user to **boot into Safe Mode** to prevent most malware processes from loading.
        *   *Windows Method: Hold Shift while clicking Restart → Troubleshoot → Advanced Options → Startup Settings → Restart → Select Safe Mode (or Safe Mode with Networking if tools need to be downloaded).*

3.  **Documentation:**
    *   **Action:** Note all user-reported symptoms and initial findings in the support ticket.

### Step 2: Identification & Scanning

With the system isolated and in a safe environment, begin active scanning.

1.  **Tool Preparation:**
    *   Ensure all security tools (Antivirus, Malwarebytes, etc.) are updated to their latest versions before running a scan. If in Safe Mode without networking, use a different PC to download the tools to a USB drive.

2.  **Scanning Procedure:**
    *   **Scan 1 (Adware Focus):** Run a scan with **ADWCleaner**. It is fast and highly effective against the most common issues (pop-ups, browser hijackers). Quarantine all findings.
    *   **Scan 2 (Broad Spectrum):** Run a "Threat Scan" or "Quick Scan" with **Malwarebytes**. This will catch a wider range of PUPs and malware. Quarantine all findings.
    *   **Scan 3 (Deep System Scan):** Run a "Full System Scan" with the primary installed antivirus. This is slower but more thorough. Quarantine all findings.
    *   **Scan 4 (If Needed):** If malware is still suspected or cannot be removed, run a **Microsoft Defender Offline** scan.

### Step 3: Verification & Restoration (Summary)

*(This section would be further detailed in a full incident report)*

1.  **Review Quarantined Items:** Check what was found to understand the nature of the infection.
2.  **Manual Cleanup:** Uninstall programs, remove malicious browser extensions, and reset browser settings.
3.  **Reboot & Verify:** Restart the computer in normal mode and run a final "all-clear" scan.
4.  **Confirm with User:** Ensure all symptoms are resolved before closing the ticket.
