# Lab 04: - Malware Removal Guide

**Objective:** To document the standard operating procedure (SOP) for addressing common malware-related customer complaints. This guide outlines how to identify symptoms, isolate an affected system, use appropriate tools for diagnosis, and follow a structured scanning procedure for remediation.

This exercise builds key IT support skills in:

*   Interpreting user-reported issues to diagnose potential malware infections.
*   Systematically isolating a compromised machine to prevent further risk.
*   Employing a multi-tool strategy for effective malware scanning and removal.
*   Communicating effectively with a user during a stressful security incident.
*   Creating clear, actionable documentation for help desk procedures.

### Key Skills

*   Customer symptom analysis and communication.
*   Incident isolation and containment (Network Disconnect, Safe Mode).
*   Use of specialized security tools (Antivirus, Malwarebytes, ADWCleaner).
*   Layered scanning techniques (Quick vs. Full Scans).
*   Procedural documentation and best practices.

### Tools Used

*   **Installed Antivirus** (for full system scan)
*   **Malwarebytes** (for adware, PUPs, and general malware)
*   **ADWCleaner** (specialized for adware and browser hijackers)
*   **Microsoft Defender Offline** (for persistent or boot-level threats)
*   **Windows Safe Mode**

## Common Customer Complaints & Symptoms

This procedure is initiated when a customer contacts the help desk with one or more of the following red-flag symptoms, which strongly indicate a malware infection.

#### **Immediate Red Flags**
- "My computer is incredibly slow and keeps freezing"
- "I'm getting constant pop-up ads everywhere"
- "My browser homepage changed and I can't change it back"
- "There are new toolbars/programs I didn't install"
- "My computer keeps redirecting to strange websites"
- (Critical) "My files have strange extensions and won't open"
- (Critical) "A message says my files are encrypted and demands payment"
- (Critical) "My antivirus disappeared and won't turn back on"

## Malware Removal Procedure

### Step 1: Initial Assessment & Isolation

The first priority is to contain the threat and gather information.

**Customer Communication:**
- *"I understand this is frustrating. Let's work through this step-by-step."*
- *"When did you first notice these symptoms?"*
- *"Have you downloaded any new software or clicked on any suspicious links recently?"*

**Technical Actions:**
1.  **Disconnect from network** - Unplug the Ethernet cable or disable Wi-Fi.
2.  **Boot into Safe Mode** - This prevents most malware from loading.
    -   *Windows Method: Hold Shift + Restart → Troubleshoot → Advanced Options → Startup Settings → Restart → Select Safe Mode.*
3.  **Document symptoms** for tracking and pattern recognition in the support ticket.

### Step 2: Identification & Scanning

With the system in a safe state, begin the scanning process.

**Primary Scanning Tools:**
1.  **Run installed antivirus** with a full system scan.
2.  **Use Malwarebytes** - Excellent for detecting and removing stubborn malware.
3.  **Microsoft Defender Offline** - Boots from a USB or recovery partition to scan before Windows loads.
4.  **ADWCleaner** - Specialized for adware and browser hijackers.

**Scanning Procedure:**
1.  Update all scanning tools to the latest virus definitions first.
2.  Run a quick scan initially to note immediate findings.
3.  Perform a full, in-depth system scan.
4.  Cross-reference the results from multiple tools for a comprehensive cleanup.

## Procedure Scope and Triage

It is crucial for an IT Support Specialist to understand the scope of any standard procedure. The `Malware Removal Procedure` documented above is specifically designed to handle common, low-to-medium risk infections. It is highly effective for certain symptoms but completely inadequate for severe threats that require immediate escalation.

### Issues Addressed by this Procedure

This procedure is effective for resolving symptoms caused by **Adware, Spyware, and Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs)**.

1.  **"My computer is incredibly slow and keeps freezing"**
    *   This procedure removes the malicious background processes that consume CPU and RAM.

2.  **"I'm getting constant pop-up ads everywhere"**
    *   Tools like ADWCleaner and Malwarebytes are specifically designed to find and eliminate the Adware responsible for this.

3.  **"My browser homepage changed and I can't change it back"**
    *   The scanning tools will remove the core hijacker, and the manual browser reset step ensures the settings are corrected.

4.  **"There are new toolbars/programs I didn't install"**
    *   The scanning tools and the manual check in "Programs and Features" will remove these unwanted installations.

5.  **"My computer keeps redirecting to strange websites"**
    *   This is another browser hijacker symptom that this procedure directly fixes.

### Critical Threats Requiring Escalation

If a user reports any of the following symptoms, **do not proceed** with the standard removal procedure. These are signs of a severe security incident that must be escalated immediately.

- **(Critical) "My files have strange extensions and won't open"**
- **(Critical) "A message says my files are encrypted and demands payment"**
    *   **What this is:** This is **Ransomware**, a major security breach.
    *   **Why this procedure is not enough:** The goal of this procedure is to *remove* malware. With ransomware, the damage (file encryption) is already done. Removing the malware will **not** decrypt the files.
    *   **The Correct Procedure:**
        1.  **IMMEDIATE ISOLATION:** Instruct the user to unplug the machine from the network instantly to prevent the ransomware from spreading.
        2.  **ESCALATE:** Report the incident to a senior IT/Security team immediately.
        3.  **REMEDIATE:** The only reliable solution is to **wipe the entire machine and restore the user's data from a known-good backup.**

- **(Critical) "My antivirus disappeared and won't turn back on"**
    *   **What this is:** This is a sign of an advanced Trojan or a **Rootkit** designed to disable system defenses.
    *   **Why this procedure might not be enough:** Malware this sophisticated can hide itself from scanners running inside the normal Windows environment. A standard scan may not detect it.
    *   **The Correct Procedure:**
        1.  **Use a Bootable Scanner:** The system must be scanned with an offline tool like **Microsoft Defender Offline** or a bootable rescue disk that runs *before* Windows starts.
        2.  **Consider it Compromised:** A machine that has had a rootkit can never be fully trusted again. The best practice is to **wipe the machine and reinstall the OS from scratch** to ensure 100% threat removal.
