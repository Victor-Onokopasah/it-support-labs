Safety Procedures Followed
1. Power Down & Unplug the PC before opening the case.
2. Wear an Anti‑Static Wrist Strap** to prevent electrostatic discharge (ESD).
3. Work on a Non‑Conductive Surface (e.g., wooden table).
4. Handle Components by the Edges — avoid touching circuitry.
5. Keep Drinks and Food Away from the workspace.
6. Organize Screws and Small Parts in a container.

Steps Taken
1. Cleared workspace and gathered tools.
2. Powered down and unplugged the PC.
3. Wore anti‑static wrist strap and connected it to a grounded surface.
4. Opened the PC case using a Phillips screwdriver.
5. Identified and photographed each internal component.
6. Closed the case and reconnected peripherals.

 Outcome
- Successfully identified all major PC components.
- Practiced safe handling procedures to prevent damage.
- Created a photo catalog of components for future reference.
